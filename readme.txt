This allows you to create a notification in gravity forms of an email that would send with the files being uploaded by that form as an attachment. Checkboxes in the notification area allow for you to setup a notification to attach files. Also ability to delete files on email getting sent.

== Description ==

Gravity Forms was built to be able to store all uploaded files to the server and email you a link.  There are times that you need to have that file get attached to the notification email.  You can now tick a checkbox in the notifications area to specify whether or not you want the file attached. If multiple files you are then able to have it attempt to zip before sending too. Also ability to delete files on email getting sent.

Works with both single and multiple upload boxes as well as multiiple notifiations.  I left the old GFUEA and GFUEANZ designations in the name for people still using it.
